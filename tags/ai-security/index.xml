      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the world of machine learning, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and deep neural networks, model extraction attacks are a growing concern. These attacks aim to replicate the behavior of a machine learning model by querying it and then using the responses to reverse-engineer its underlying architecture and parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-model-extraction-attack&#34;&gt;What is a Model Extraction Attack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;model extraction attack&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when an adversary tries to replicate a machine learning model by making repeated queries to it and analyzing its responses. The goal of the attacker is to create a new model that mimics the target modelâ€™s functionality, often without direct access to its architecture or parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
