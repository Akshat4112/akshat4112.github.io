When people say "Transformers revolutionized NLP," what they *really* mean is:
> **Attention** revolutionized NLP.

From GPT and BERT to LLaMA and Claude, **attention mechanisms** are the beating heart of modern large language models.

But what exactly is attention? Why is it so powerful? And how many types are there?

Let's dive in.

## 🧠 What is Attention?

In the simplest sense, **attention is a way for a model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when generating output**.

It answers:
> "Given this word, which other words should I pay attention to — and how much?"

## 🔢 The Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Let's break it down mathematically.

Given:
- Query matrix $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$
- Key matrix $K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$
- Value matrix $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$

The attention output is:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V$$

- $QK^\top$: Dot product measures similarity
- $\sqrt{d_k}$: Scaling factor to avoid large softmax values
- softmax: Turns similarity into attention weights
- $V$: Weighted sum of value vectors

## 🔁 Multi-Head Attention

Instead of applying one attention function, we apply it **multiple times in parallel** with different projections.

$$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O$$
$$\text{where head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)$$

Each head learns different types of relationships (e.g., syntactic, semantic).

## 🧩 Types of Attention in Transformers

Let's look at the key attention variations used in different transformer architectures.

### 1. **Self-Attention**
- Query, Key, and Value come from the **same input**.
- Used in encoder and decoder blocks.
- Each token attends to **every other token** (or just previous ones in causal attention).

$$\text{SelfAttention}(X) = \text{Attention}(X, X, X)$$

### 2. **Cross-Attention**
- Used in encoder-decoder models like T5 or BART.
- Query comes from decoder, Key & Value come from encoder output.

$$\text{CrossAttention}(Q_{\text{decoder}}, K_{\text{encoder}}, V_{\text{encoder}})$$

### 3. **Masked (Causal) Attention**
- Used in autoregressive models like GPT.
- Prevents tokens from attending to future tokens.
- Enforced using a **triangular mask**.

$$\text{MaskedAttention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M\right)V$$
where $M$ is a mask with $-\infty$ in upper triangle.

### 4. **Local Attention**
- Each token only attends to a **local window** (e.g., ±128 tokens).
- Reduces compute from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nw)$

Used in models like Longformer ([Beltagy et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150))

### 5. **Sparse Attention**
- Instead of full attention, use pre-defined patterns (e.g., strided, global).
- Reduces memory usage.

Examples:
- **BigBird** ([Zaheer et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062))
- **Reformer** ([Kitaev et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451))

### 6. **Linear / Kernelized Attention**
- Approximates attention with linear complexity.
- Replace softmax with kernel function:
$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \phi(Q)(\phi(K)^\top V)$$

Used in **Performer** ([Choromanski et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794))

### 7. **Memory-Augmented Attention**
- Adds **external memory vectors** (e.g., key-value cache, documents).
- Popular in **RAG** and **MoE** systems.

## 🏗️ Attention Block in Transformers

Each Transformer layer consists of:

1. **Multi-head Attention**
2. **Add & Layer Norm**
3. **Feed Forward Network**
4. **Add & Layer Norm**

```text
Input → [Multi-head Attention] → Add & Norm → [FFN] → Add & Norm → Output
```

Transformers stack these layers 12–96 times depending on size (BERT-base vs GPT-4 scale).

## 🧪 Why Attention Works

- **Position-invariant**: Doesn't care where a word is, just what it's related to
- **Parallelizable**: Unlike RNNs
- **Interpretable**: You can visualize what the model is "looking at"

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Attention isn't just a component — it is the innovation that powers modern LLMs.

From GPT's self-attention to BERT's bidirectional masking, every major NLP breakthrough builds on this core idea:

> "Pay attention to what matters — and learn how to pay attention."

In upcoming posts, I'll dive into positional encodings, attention visualization, and how LoRA modifies attention layers.
