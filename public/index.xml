      <description>Paper
Authors: Akshat Gupta, Laxman Singh Tomar, Ridhima Garg
Abstract Cyber attacks deceive machines into believing something that does not exist in the first place. However, there are some to which even humans fall prey. One such famous attack that attackers have used over the years to exploit the vulnerability of vision is known to be a Homoglyph attack. It employs a primary yet effective mechanism to create illegitimate domains that are hard to differentiate from legit ones.</description>

      <description>Generative modeling is currently one of the most thrilling domains in deep learning research. Traditional models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in synthetically generating realistic data, such as images and text. However, diffusion models is swiftly gaining prominence as a powerful model in the arena of high-quality and stable generative modeling. This blog explores diffusion models, examining their operational mechanisms, architectural designs, training processes, sampling methods, and the key advantages that position them at the forefront of generative AI.</description>

      <description>As machine learning systems are increasingly used in critical areas like finance, employment, and criminal justice, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to ensure these models are fair and do not discriminate against certain groups. In this post, I will explore the concept of fairness in machine learning.
Defining Fairness Fairness in machine learning can be understood in several ways:
Group Fairness: This implies equal treatment or outcomes for different groups categorized by sensitive attributes like race or gender.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a machine learning engineer and my research interests are in generative modelling, speech processing, text analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. Currently pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s from the University of Stuttgart, my major is in computational linguistics.
Current work Research work includes denoising diffusion on speaker embeddings, explainability of CRF-LSTM-based NER models, temporal and spatial word embeddings, and homoglyph detection using attention-based CNNs.
My work includes Before this, I worked at Quantiphi, Scanta, and Mobile Programming LLC as a machine learning engineer and worked on speaker diarization, multimodal sentiment analysis, NLP augmentor, clinical ner, chatbot using AWS Lex and Dialogflow, customer care call analytics, neural machine translation.</description>
