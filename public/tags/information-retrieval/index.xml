      <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT or LLaMA are great at generating text. But there&amp;rsquo;s a catch:
They only know what they were trained on, and that knowledge is frozen at training time.
So what happens when you ask them something from after their training cutoff? Or something super niche, like a policy from your internal HR docs?
Enter RAG â€“ Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
A technique that combines LLMs with a search engine, enabling them to look up facts on the fly.</description>
