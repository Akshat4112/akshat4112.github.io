      <description>In the world of machine learning, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and deep neural networks, model extraction attacks are a growing concern. These attacks aim to replicate the behavior of a machine learning model by querying it and then using the responses to reverse-engineer its underlying architecture and parameters.
What is a Model Extraction Attack? A model extraction attack occurs when an adversary tries to replicate a machine learning model by making repeated queries to it and analyzing its responses.</description>
