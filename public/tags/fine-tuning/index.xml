      <description>As powerful as large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral are, theyâ€™re still general-purpose. If you want to make them truly useful for your domainâ€”whether itâ€™s legal documents, financial analysis, or German tax lawâ€”you need to fine-tune them.
And thanks to a technique called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), you can now fine-tune LLMs with a fraction of the data, compute, and cost.
ðŸ”§ What is Fine-Tuning? Fine-tuning is the process of continuing the training of a pre-trained LLM on your own dataset so that it learns domain-specific patterns, vocabulary, tone, or tasks.</description>
