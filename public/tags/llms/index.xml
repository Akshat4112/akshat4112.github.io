      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all played with ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude â€” typing in questions and marveling at their responses. But behind the scenes, there&amp;rsquo;s a powerful craft at play: prompt engineering.
It&amp;rsquo;s not just about &amp;ldquo;asking a question.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s about how you phrase it, structure it, and guide the model. Prompt engineering is the new programming skill â€” and it&amp;rsquo;s transforming how we interact with AI.
ðŸ§  What Is Prompt Engineering? Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective input prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to produce accurate, helpful, or creative outputs.</description>

      <description>In the world of machine learning, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and deep neural networks, model extraction attacks are a growing concern. These attacks aim to replicate the behavior of a machine learning model by querying it and then using the responses to reverse-engineer its underlying architecture and parameters.
What is a Model Extraction Attack? A model extraction attack occurs when an adversary tries to replicate a machine learning model by making repeated queries to it and analyzing its responses.</description>
