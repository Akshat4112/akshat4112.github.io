      <description>Speaker anonymization refers to the process of modifying the characteristics of a speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice so that the speaker&amp;rsquo;s identity cannot be easily determined while preserving the speech&amp;rsquo;s intelligibility. With the increasing usage of speech data in virtual assistants, surveillance systems, and other applications, ensuring privacy in speech data has become critical.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into the technical details of speaker anonymization techniques, including implementation approaches using machine learning, deep learning models, and popular libraries.</description>
