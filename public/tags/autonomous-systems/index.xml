      <description>Understanding LLM Agents: The Future of Autonomous AI Systems Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3, GPT-4, and others, have taken the world by storm due to their impressive language generation and understanding capabilities. However, when these models are augmented with decision-making capabilities, memory, and actions in specific environments, they become even more powerful. Enter LLM Agents â€” autonomous systems built on top of large language models to perform tasks, make decisions, and act autonomously based on user instructions.</description>
