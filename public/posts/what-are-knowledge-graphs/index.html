But what exactly is a knowledge graph, and why is everyone suddenly obsessed with it?\nIn this post, I’ll break down knowledge graphs in plain language: what they are, how they work, and how I use them in my own projects.\n🧱 The Basics: What Is a Knowledge Graph? At its core, a knowledge graph is a network of real-world entities (people, places, things) and the relationships between them. It’s how machines can represent, understand, and reason about the world — kind of like a human brain, but for structured data.\nIn technical terms:\nA knowledge graph is a graph-based data structure that encodes entities as nodes and relationships as edges, enriched with semantics via an ontology.\nHere’s a simple example:\n“Elon Musk” —[CEO of]→ “Tesla” “Tesla” —[makes]→ “Cybertruck” “Cybertruck” —[type]→ “Electric Vehicle”\nEvery node is an entity. Every edge is a predicate (relationship). And the whole structure is queryable, explorable, and often inferable.\n🕸️ Why Use a Graph? Traditional databases work with rows and tables. But in real life, information is messy and connected.\nA person can work for multiple companies. A product can belong to many categories. Concepts can be linked across domains. Graphs handle this interconnectedness naturally. That’s why big tech uses them:\nGoogle’s Knowledge Graph for better search answers. Facebook’s social graph to model user relationships. Amazon’s product graph for recommendations. 💡 How Is It Different from a Database? Feature Relational DB Knowledge Graph Data model Tables Nodes \u0026 edges Relationships Joins (explicit) First-class citizens (edges) Schema Rigid Flexible (ontology-driven) Query language SQL SPARQL / Cypher Semantics Implicit Explicit \u0026 machine-readable Graphs are schema-light and flexible, which makes them perfect for AI, NLP, and dynamic domains.\n🧠 Where Are Knowledge Graphs Used? Here’s where knowledge graphs really shine:\n🔍 Semantic Search\nEnables intent-based results (e.g., “founder of Tesla” → Elon Musk)\n🧠 LLM Context Injection (RAG)\nUse a knowledge graph to retrieve precise facts and inject them into prompts — improving GenAI accuracy.\n🏥 Healthcare \u0026 Life Sciences\nModel relationships between diseases, symptoms, genes, drugs.\n💼 Enterprise Intelligence\nUnify data silos across CRM, HR, finance, support.\n🔗 Data Integration \u0026 Interoperability\nLink structured + unstructured data through common semantics.\n⚙️ Key Components of a Knowledge Graph Here’s what goes into a real-world knowledge graph:\nEntities: The nodes — people, places, products, concepts. Relationships: The edges — how entities are connected. Ontology: Defines classes, properties, and constraints. (Read my ontology post for details!) Identifiers: Unique URIs to refer to each concept. Query Layer: Languages like SPARQL or Cypher to retrieve insights. 🧪 My Use Cases I’ve worked with knowledge graphs in several domains:\nInsurance Claims Automation: Extract structured facts from documents using OpenAI + Neo4j to speed up FNOL (First Notice of Loss). RAG Pipelines: Create mini knowledge graphs from PDFs and inject triples into prompts for better LLM accuracy. German Tax Assistant: Model deductions, expenses, and income types as nodes to generate explainable tax advice. Whether it’s documents, chatbots, or graphs powering LLMs — KGs make AI smarter and explainable.\n🧰 Popular Tools for Building KGs Neo4j: Popular graph database (uses Cypher). RDF \u0026 SPARQL: W3C standards for linked data. Stardog: Enterprise-grade knowledge graph platform. GraphDB: Great for RDF-based graphs. LangChain: Integrates LLMs with KG-based retrievers. 🔍 Final Thoughts If you’re working with LLMs, messy data, or just want your system to understand things better, knowledge graphs are a superpower. They’re the connective tissue between raw data and semantic meaning.\nIn a world where AI often hallucinates, knowledge graphs ground your models in truth, logic, and explainability.\nGot a use case you’re working on? Feel free to reach out — happy to jam on graph ideas!\n— Akshat\n","wordCount":"630","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-15T09:00:00+01:00","dateModified":"2024-03-15T09:00:00+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://akshat4112.github.io/posts/what-are-knowledge-graphs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Akshat Gupta","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://akshat4112.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Akshat Gupta (Alt + H)">Akshat Gupta</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/posts title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/publications/ title=Publications><span>Publications</span></a></li><li><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/talks/ title=Talks><span>Talks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/events/ title=Events><span>Events</span></a></li><li><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qj6kaZXM40ixUgOAewhZlTj57piWERSw/view?usp=drive_link" title=CV><span>CV</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://akshat4112.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What Are Knowledge Graphs?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-15 09:00:00 +0100 CET'>March 15, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=post-content><p>We hear the term <strong>knowledge graph</strong> everywhere now — from Google Search to enterprise AI to GenAI apps.
